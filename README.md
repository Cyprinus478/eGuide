# Project Title

eGuide is a new project to create a digital field guide on your phone. Instead of being like all the other identification apps which use AI to get sloppy identifications, or a phisical book which can be cumbersome and can damage your books; eGuide will instead be a digital field guide that'll make field identification easier. 


## Planned Features

1. Throughough descriptions and images to help identify plants, animals, and fungi
2. Range maps and, if possible, iNaturalist observation heat maps
3. Search for species by trait (i.e. ability to look for plants by filtering for single leaves, serated leaves, and leaves that alternate the stem)
4. Blooming dates for flowers
